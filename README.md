This example demonstrates a common error in React's `useEffect` hook.  Forgetting to include `count` in the dependency array leads to an infinite loop because the effect runs after every render, changing the `count` state, and triggering a re-render. This creates a continuous cycle. The solution involves correctly specifying the dependencies to ensure the effect runs only when the specified variables change.
